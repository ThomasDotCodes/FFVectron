Those scenes require Octane 2018.1 to work.

Before loading the first scene, you have to set up the osl-include-path in Octane (otherwise most formulas will not work, because the header ff-vectron.h will be missing):
- start Octane and enter the Preferences (menu File -> Preferences)
- watch for the option "OSL include directories"
- add the path to your FFVectron-folder, e. g. D:\GFX\FFVectron
- hit "Ok"
