# FFVectron
Library of Fractal Formulas for Octane Vectron

The final goal is be able to create complex fractal art in a most simple way. E.g., the awesome stuff you can create with MB3D. 
Having some classic formulas is just the early beginning :-)

I'm testing this from within Lightwave and Houdini, but the supplied *.osl-files are not Lightwave- or Houdini related. 
So you may use them in Octane directly, or also in Cinema4D or in similar packages.

But, for your convenience, some Houdini-projects-files are provided as well. 
They should work "out-of-the-box" if you have Octane and the Houdini-Octane-plugin installed.
