# FFVectron
Library of Fractal Formulas for Octane Vectron

The final goal is be able to create complex fractal art in a most simple way. E.g., the awesome stuff you can create with MB3D. 
Having some classic formulas is just he early beginning :-)

I'm testing this from within Lightwave, but the supplied *.osl-files are not Lightwave-related. So you may use them in Octane directly, or also in Cinema4D or in similar packages.
